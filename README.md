# Alzheimers-MRI-Classification
Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using deep learning and image analysis

This is my diploma thesis for my degree in Biomedical Engineering.

The thesis aims at developing and evaluating an advanced deep learning model for analyzing brain MRI images and classifying them into stages of Alzheimer's disease by detecting the degree of brain atrophy. The code is written with Python programming language and uses open source libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras and NumPy.

The thesis presents the development of a deep learning-based code using TensorFlow to classify MRI brain images in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. The opening chapters offer an overview of Alzheimer's disease, discussing its causes and symptoms, and delve into diagnostic techniques, with an emphasis on MRI imaging. The project then explores the theoretical aspects of deep learning, highlighting its potential applications in medical diagnostics and summarizing the architecture and effectiveness of deep learning techniques. 
The core of the thesis is dedicated to the development and implementation methodology of the code, which was written in Python using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The process involved running the code, analyzing the results, and addressing challenges, particularly in terms of code performance. Initially, was the code performing poorly due to overfitting. However, through various tweaks and tests, a marginal improvement in performance was achieved. 
A major challenge faced was the limited size of the MRI brain image set, particularly in the "Moderate Demented" and "Mild Demented" categories. This limitation hindered the code's ability to effectively train and recognize complex details in images for accurate classification. In contrast, the "Non Demented" and "Very Mild Demented" categories presented larger datasets. 
In conclusion, while the developed code shows potential, its effectiveness is limited by the lack of extensive data. The work suggests that expanding the dataset, especially to underrepresented categories, could significantly improve the code's performance and accuracy in classifying Alzheimer's disease stages.
